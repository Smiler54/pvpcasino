-- Note: Views (jackpot_public_stats, public_profiles, public_profiles_secure) 
-- cannot have RLS enabled directly. Their security is controlled by the underlying tables.
-- The views inherit security from the underlying jackpot_games and profiles tables,
-- which already have proper RLS policies in place.

-- Verify that the underlying tables have proper RLS policies
-- (jackpot_games and profiles tables already have RLS enabled and proper policies)

-- Add a comment to document the security approach for views
